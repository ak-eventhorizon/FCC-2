## 1 - Palindrome Checker

### Test Case:

Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

***Note:***

You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

## 2 - Roman Numeral Converter

### Test Case:

Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

| Symbol | I | V |  X |  L |  C  |  D  |   M  |
|:------:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
|  Value | 1 | 5 | 10 | 50 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |

***Note:***

All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.

## 3 - Caesars Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' <-> 'N', 'B' <-> 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

***Note:***

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
